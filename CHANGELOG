Ana-Gabriel (3):
      Moved changedir to shell-utils, and added pushd and popd. Fix #21
      fixed the syntax error output for pushd,     and printed the stack after pushd and popd
      fixed some shit. But there still needs to be something that tests whether     a name returned by wildcard is a directory or not

Hunter Allen (6):
      Trying to reduce conflicts.
      Removed shift and reduce conflicts in the bison code and refactored.
      Uhm. That was bad.
      Fixed a small invalid read issue.
      Fixing some small performance things.
      bump to v0.0.5

Hunter L. Allen (34):
      Uh. Ya. So... Subshell is hard @Purdrew2
      FINALLY, Fix #1.
      Added test cases.
      Fixed the sorting order in the bison file.
      Adding tests to CI.
      Forgot a label.
      No idea.
      The freaking tab v space thing.
      Ok. Pretty major changes. But, the leaks in #24 are fixed. The remaining leaks come from wildcard_expand, so @Anagabriel needs to look at what regcomp does. Cause apparently it calls malloc.
      Ok. That should do it.
      Fixed the leak in wildcard!
      Got the first part working. Going to add a global flag now.
      Actually, I don't think we necessarily need the global flag... I think that's a separate feature. So, if it is desired, please file as a separate issue. For now, I'm going to say close #25.
      Todo: write a test for this. Somehow, this isn't simple.
      Working on multi-line editing.
      Merge branch 'master' of http://allen-software.com/gitlab/allensoftware/YaSh into 16-multi-line-editor
      Moving function headers around so that Ubuntu doesn't complain.
      This is hard.
      Backspace over two lines works!!!!!!!!!!
      Re-indented and worked on backspace with multiple lines.
      Updated readme.
      Making the readline class cleaner and more readable. Cause... it's gross.
      Continuing to refactor the shell-readline class.
      Still working on yacc file.
      That's probably as good as we're gonna get on the multi-line editor.
      Ready for merge
      Added debug mode compile flags.
      Removed default C/C++ flags from autoconf.
      Merge branch 'master' of http://allen-software.com/gitlab/allensoftware/YaSh
      Added CHANGELOG
      Tab complete over binaries works for exact matches.
      Production for #12
      Fixed small issue with the pushd and popd with wildcards.
      Merge !25. Close #21
