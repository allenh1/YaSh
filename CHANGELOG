Cleaned a small memory leak in the wildcard.

Removed extraneous character.

Made indentation scheme consistent.

but is the best I can do for now.

Working on ARM exclusive ctrl + a bug.

Fixed extra tab in ci

Made functions take const thing references.

Removed unnecessary sort call from wildcard, as well as made the bash locale match that of our sort.

Added history command with the `--no-lineno` function. Seems to be working nicely!

sorry the previous one I forgot to save in emacs, here is the real stuff

I used kleenex and Windows should be more clear to install now

Things are installing now. But I'm not quite pleased with this.

Some good progress on fg. The window reappears now, but is... Not correct.

Ok! So the jobs are actually stoppping!

Gustavo Rodriquez-Rivera pointed out a small issue in the execute
that leaked a file descriptor.

This fixes it.

In the future, we should use `ulimit -n 32` and test it.
He also tried `strace -f -o t,.out yash`, but strace wasn't installed.
