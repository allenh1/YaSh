Shell Project Testing Script
----------------------------

1. Make sure that your shell project does not print
debug messages. The output will be compared with the one
of csh and the extra debug messages will cause the output
to be different.

2. Only print the shell prompt if the input is a terminal.
Use the function "isatty()" to know if the input is a terminal or not.
Add the following code to your shell in the prompt procedure:

if ( isatty(0) ) {
  Print prompt
}

3. The test script assumes that your shell executable is called "shell"
and "shell" is found one directory above the test directory.

4. To run all tests type "testall". You may also run each test
individually by typing test1 etc.

Good luck!
